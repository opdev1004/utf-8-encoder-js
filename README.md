- Original source code: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURIComponent

This script does not contain what is written inside of encodeURIComponent() from Javascript. It uses encodeURIComponent() and just replaces the characters that is not encoded by encodeURIComponent().
